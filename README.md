# What is this plugin?

This plugin is specifically for Arabic learners and allows you to create a psuedo dictionary for your vault which you can search.

I built it to help me search more quickly while learning because the basic obsidian search is too broad - I needed it to be restricted to just one folder, and to ignore harkaat since I don't wanna match exactly the harakaat when im looking for a word I remember. 

## How to use

Make a folder for your arabic content in your vault. 

For me my vault looks like:

Learning/
	Arabic/
		Words/
			1-Set
			2-Set
			...
			New
		Media/
			...
		Notes/
			...
	School/
		...
	...
...

I would set my filepath in setting to be "Learning/Arabic" if I want to search everything in the Arabic folder, or "Learning/Arabic/Words" if I want to only restrict it to the Words folder.

Words is essentially a collection of 1-1 entries of English and Arabic words. I do it this way to export to anki with a custom script (let me know if you want that script too)
